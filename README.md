## Requirements

- Node 18 LTS/Hydrogen (LTS is recommended)

## Setup

1. Initialize your DB.

2. Create an `.env` file and add variables.

3. Install all the packages
    ```
    yarn
    ```
4. Ensure that you have an active DB, and run a migration
    ```
    yarn db:dev:migrate
    ```
5. Start the application
    ```
    yarn start:dev
    ```
## Migrations

After updating the `prisma/schema.prisma` file with the new models, you
can run the `yarn db:test:migrate` command to test the current state of
your DB. If you are satisfied with the state, you can then run `yarn db:dev:migrate`
to run schema migrations.

You can learn more [here](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-migrate/getting-started).
